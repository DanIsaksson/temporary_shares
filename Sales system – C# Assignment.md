ASSIGNMENT

#### **Sales system**


1. Project goal


The group will help a small cinema hall with a new sales system, which

should register sales of tickets and a very limited assortment of snacks.

Payment is dealt with already, but only with the actual money transfer.


The system will be used by sales staff working on site, helping them guide
the user to an optimal choice of film experience.


An accountant takes a look at the economy regularly, so sales numbers and

VAT should be tracked on a monthly basis.


2. Game Rules to implement


You will need to figure out how to proceed, both in terms of how you work

as a group and how you build a system from the data you have. The project

depends to a high degree on your judgement and imagination.


You will have a repository on our group organization account on GitHub.


Work until Friday August 22 at 15:00.
